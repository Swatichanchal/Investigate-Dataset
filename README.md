# Investigate-Dataset

## Project: Investigate a Dataset (No-show appointments Data)
### Introduction
### DATASET
**Data Dictionary**
- **01 - PatientId :** Identification of a patient
- **02 - AppointmentID :** Identification of each appointment
- **03 - Gender :** Male or Female . Female is the greater proportion, woman takes way more care of they health in comparison to man.
- **04 - DataMarcacaoConsulta :** The day of the actuall appointment, when they have to visit the doctor.
- **05 - DataAgendamento :** The day someone called or registered the appointment, this is before appointment of course.
- **06 - Age :** How old is the patient.
- **07 - Neighbourhood :** Where the appointment takes place.
- **08 - Scholarship :** True of False . Observation, this is a broad topic
- **09 - Hipertension :** True or False
- **10 - Diabetes :** True or False
- **Alcoholism :** True or False
- **Handcap :** True or False
- **SMS_received :** 1 or more messages sent to the patient.
- **No-show :** True or False.
There are `13 Independent Variables` -> ['PatientId' 'AppointmentID' 'Gender' 'ScheduledDay' 'AppointmentDay' 'Age' 'Neighbourhood' 'Scholarship' 'Hypertension' 'Diabetes' 'Alcoholism' 'Handicap' 'SMSReceived']
The `Dependent Variable` is -> ['NoShow']

### Project Overview
In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

### What do I need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

- * pandas
- * NumPy
- * Matplotlib
- * csv
We recommend installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook. You can find installation instructions here.

### Why this Project?
In this project, you'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.

You'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

### What will I learn?
After completing the project, you will:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
